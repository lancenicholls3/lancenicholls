### Description
I developed a **screw loading module** to streamline **pre-operative verification** for spinal surgeries.  
The design accommodates up to **20 pedicle screws**, enabling surgeons to **predetermine screw selection** and efficiently verify both length and diameter before the procedure.  

By integrating this module into the workflow, surgeons can prepare their instrumentation in advance, which significantly **reduces surgical time and lowers the risk of error**.  
The result is a more reliable and efficient pre-op process that enhances both surgeon confidence and patient safety.
