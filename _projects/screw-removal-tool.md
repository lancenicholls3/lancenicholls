I redesigned a surgical screw removal tool to accommodate **10+ different pedicle screw types**, making it significantly more versatile in clinical use.  

To improve surgeon ergonomics, I integrated **welded handles** that enhanced grip and usability during procedures.  

The result: a **more adaptable and user-friendly instrument** that streamlines the surgical workflow.
