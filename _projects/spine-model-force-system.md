### Description
I designed a biomechanical force system to simulate forces within the body on both **pediatric and adult plastic spine models**.  

The setup used an **adjustable pegboard with eyebolts and springs** of varying stiffness. These could be stretched across a wide distance range, applying **0.5–20 lbf** to any vertebrae from **200+ positions** both laterally and radially.  

This technical decision allowed surgeons to **demo nearly any tool or instrument** thanks to the high degree of customizability.
