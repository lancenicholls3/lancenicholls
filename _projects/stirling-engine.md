As part of my **Manufacturing Engineering** course, I designed and built a fully functional **Stirling engine** using precision machining techniques.  

The project involved **milling, turning, sand casting, and sheet metal fabrication**, giving me hands-on experience with traditional manufacturing methods and tight-tolerance assembly.  

My focus on precision allowed the engine to **run smoothly and reliably**, and strengthened my understanding of machining dynamic systems.
