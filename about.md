    <p>
      I’m a junior at Johns Hopkins majoring in <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> with minors in <strong>Psychology</strong> and <strong>Applied Math & Statistics</strong>, and I compete on the varsity cross-country and track teams. My experience as an athlete sparked a passion for <strong>biomechanics</strong>, which I’ve explored through research and hands-on engineering projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the lab and classroom, I’m deeply passionate about <strong>nature and exploring the outdoors</strong>, which fuels my curiosity about human performance, resilience, and design. I aim to build a career in industry developing <strong>innovative biomechanical technologies</strong>—from performance footwear that pushes human potential to medical devices that improve lives.
