I’m a junior at Johns Hopkins majoring in Mechanical Engineering with minors in Psychology and Applied Math & Statistics, and I compete on the varsity cross-country and track teams. My experience as an athlete sparked a passion for biomechanics, which I’ve explored through research and hands-on engineering projects. Outside the lab and classroom, I’m deeply passionate about nature and exploring the outdoors, which fuels my curiosity about human performance and design. I aim to build a career in industry developing innovative biomechanical technologies, whether it be performance footwear that pushes human potential or medical devices that improve lives.
