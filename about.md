  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <p>
      I’m a junior at Johns Hopkins majoring in Mechanical Engineering with minors in Psychology and Applied Math & Statistics, and I compete on the varsity cross-country and track teams. My experience as an athlete sparked a passion for biomechanics, which I’ve explored through research and hands-on engineering projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the lab and classroom, I’m deeply passionate about nature and exploring the outdoors, which fuels my curiosity about human performance, resilience, and design. I aim to build a career in industry developing innovative biomechanical technologies—from performance footwear that pushes human potential to medical devices that improve lives.
