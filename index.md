    <p>
      I’m a junior at Johns Hopkins majoring in Mechanical Engineering with minors in
      Psychology and Applied Math & Statistics, and I compete on the varsity cross-country
      and track teams. My experience as an athlete sparked a passion for biomechanics, which I’ve explored
      through research and hands-on engineering projects.

    <p>
      Outside the lab and classroom, I’m deeply passionate about nature and exploring the outdoors, which
      fuels my curiosity about human performance, resilience, and design. I aim to build a career in industry developing
      innovative biomechanical technologies, whether it be performance footwear that pushes human potential or medical
      devices that improve lives.
